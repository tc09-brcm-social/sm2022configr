# configr
This is the first release of the SiteMinder Config Retriever file structure
base on the SiteMinder 12.8/sp7 container form factor beta build.
Testing was done up to the 12.8.07.2884 build.

This first release is served as a skeleton to be used to build
both the customization config retriever and runtime config retriever
a particular helm installation of the server component and access gateway
may need. As a matter of fact, the git release of this file structure
is on the branch "skeleton." There is no other branch at all at this
first release.

* It is important to mention that this first release comes the following:
	* a number of .README.md file under the various subdirectories
		* those are meant to be used to document whatever
		* files are presented there.
		* Over time, these README files will be populated
		* with documentations regarding the usage of the
		* corresponding subdirectories.
`	* server.crt - a self-signed certificate
		* under the access gateway customization
		* config retriever
	* server.key the corresponding encrypted private key
		* the encryption word used is "pasword".
	* server.clear the corresponding private key
		* that is in the clear, non-encrypted
	* the regular CA bundle file, however, is not included
		* This is to allow the standard access gateway
		* deployment to carry its own OOTB version.
		* One can certainly carry one to overwrite
		* the system generated one.
* deploy - the customization config retriever structure
* runtime - the runtime config retriever structure
